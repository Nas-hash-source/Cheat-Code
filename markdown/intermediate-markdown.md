# Intermediate Markdown

## Table

Add three dashes --- or more for underline the header, and use pipe | 
for seperating the columns

when you want to add a pipe | in a table, use the html character "&#124;"

|Element  |Symbol   |
|:-------  |:------:  |
|code     |backtick`|

### Alignment in the table

To the left, add a colon to the left of the dashes. To the right, add it to the right. To center, add it to the left and to the right

## Fenced Code Blocks

Instead of indenting , you can enclose your code blocks with three backticks (```) or three tildes (~~~)

### Higlighting syntax
After the three backticks or tildes , specify the code such as json html javascript python

## Footnote
A superscript that refers like in a book and it contains a difficult word which will be referred in the bottom of the page.

Referer: [^difficult] or [^whatever]

then [^difficult]: it explains the difficulty of it

[^whatever]: whatever the word, the references go here
