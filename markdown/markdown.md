# Markdown

## Formatting text

Italic: _text_ enclose with dash _ or one asterisk
Bold: **text** enclose with two asterisks
NB: you can nest the one within the other

## Header

Use Hash sign (#) plus a space (recommended) for making a header, the number of it will determine the header to one, two or three...
Best practice to leave a blank line before and after the header.
#Header One 
##Header Two
###Header Three
...
######Header Six

## Link in Markdown

### Inline link

[Link to the markdown tutorial where I got those notes](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/), enclose your linked words with [], followed by the link enclosed with ()

### Reference link

Instead of making a lot of inline links for the same website link, enclose your linked words with [], followed with a reference or a variable with another [].
At the end of a markdown document. Assign the variable, should be enclosed again with [] followed by a colon : then after the link

[Link to google][google]
[Link to google again][google]
[google] : www.google.com

## Insert an image

Inserting an image is like adding a link but only, before the first bracket, need a "!"
![Alt text][Image link]

And it can be referenced like the referenced link as well. ANd we declare it at the end of the document

## Blockquote

adding ">" before the blockquote, or adding several ">" if it contains multipled paragraphs
>This is a quote

## List

1) Unordered list, add juste one "*" and just one space before the list item
* List number 1
* List number 2

2) Ordered list, add number like "1.space" "2.space"
1. ordered list number 1
2. ordered list number 2

3) Nested list, you just indent one more space and start the list again
* unordered list
 * nested list number 1
 * nested list number 2

4) Recommended not to use over three nested list, and when you want the list like the lines below, you should step one space and write again.
* This is my list
 And I want to align this line to my list above
 Same for it

## Paragraph
Use a blank line to seperate the text, recommended not to indent it literally, for a normal break!
But when you want to assemble and categorize paragraph such as a poem -- add two space after each line of sentences (You can use this technique for the list as well for the sense of assembling)
